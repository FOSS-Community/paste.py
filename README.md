paste.py üêç - A pastebin written in python.

# ü§î Pre-requisites

- `python3`
- `pdm`

## üêç Python Version Support

This project is designed to be compatible with specific versions of Python for optimal performance and stability.

### Supported Python Version

- **Python 3.11.3**

> ‚ùóÔ∏è For the best experience and performance, it is recommended to use the version mentioned above.

Before diving into the project, ensure that you have the correct Python version installed. To check the version of Python you currently have, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

### üêç Installing Python 3.11.3 with `pyenv`

**Protip:** Managing multiple Python versions is a breeze with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). It allows you to seamlessly switch between different Python versions without the need to reinstall them.

If you haven't installed `pyenv` yet, follow their [official guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to set it up.

Once you have `pyenv` ready, install the recommended Python version by running:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.3
```

> When you navigate to this project's directory in the future, `pyenv` will automatically select the recommended Python version, thanks to the `.python-version` file in the project root.

  - You can also use `pdm run dev` to start the dev server.

## Setting Up and Testing the Project

To ensure the code quality and functionality of the project, follow the steps below:

### Installing Git Hooks with `pre-commit`

Before making any commits, it's essential to ensure that your code meets the quality standards. This project utilizes `pre-commit` hooks to automatically check your changes before any commit.

Install the pre-commit hooks with the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

To ensure the project's functionality, you should run all the provided tests. Execute the following command to run the tests:

```bash
pdm run test
```

### Testing the Running Server

Once you have your server up and running, you can send requests to it from another terminal to test its responsiveness and functionality.

Here are a couple of `GET` requests you can make using [curl](https://curl.se/):

```bash
curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/health
```

> These endpoints typically return the health status or readiness of the server, helping in diagnostics and monitoring.
